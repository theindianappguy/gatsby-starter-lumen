I was posting dribbble shot for [CertifySimple App](https://www.certifysimple.app), i wanted to add link to the site now adding link with https:/... does not look good

## Embed Links in your dribbble shot

You can embed links anywhere in the dribbble shot caption begining, middle or end.

Here is the code snippet:

`<a href="url" rel="nofollow noreferrer">label</a>`

When posting add the code like this

![Embed link in dribbble shot step1](/media/embed-link-dribbble-shot-step-1.png)

This is how it will look like when posted

![Embed link in dribbble shot step2](/media/embed-link-dribbble-shot-step-2.png)

So as you can see its that easy, checkout the [dribbble shot i posted](https://dribbble.com/shots/16242536-web-design-landing-page)
