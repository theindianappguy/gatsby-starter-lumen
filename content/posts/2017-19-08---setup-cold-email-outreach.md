From Dec 2020 i have been self employed working on own micro saas apps, there are different things i tried like directory listing, sharing link in social media and then launching on appsumo.

But all of these ways have one problem there is limit to how much you can do their are limited directory sites, you can't just post about your app daily then nobody will follow.

So when I got to know about cold email outreach the things that attracts me is

- scalability - there are billions of people using email your audience is there and major of it
- low cost - sending is email is so affordable
- its easy - i have done cold calls and a lot of them, Everytime new call is placed my heart use to beat what if customer scream at me what if he said no but with email just write it and click send can reaching potential customers can get easier than this?

In this blog we will go step by step setting up cold email outreach for your business.

I will give major example of saas because that is what i sell, but this will work with any other bussiness as well.
