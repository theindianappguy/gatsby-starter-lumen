Do you use google forms? If yes have you faced the issue of not able to receive important notifications like when someone submit your form?

I faced the same issues with my product [blurweb.app](https://blurweb.app) affiliate program application form because i was not able to receive the notification I was not able to contact the affiliates hence loosing potential revenue.

I tried setting up with my Email but even when i cleaned it once it just someone how gets cluttered and i don't get notification for each mail. Hence i looked at other options which i use and slack was an obvious choice.
