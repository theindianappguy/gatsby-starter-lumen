I will show how to setup SlackNotify App to receive slack notifications on google form submit.

This is a Two Step Process:

1. Slack Setup
2. Google Form Setup

## Slack Setup

Visit: https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks here we will create an app provide it a name and generate a incoming webhook url (follow the video)

Once done we will have a webhook url.

2. Open any google form or create new.
